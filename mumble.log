FalconWiz: i dont have a bunch of the sounds on there but
FalconWiz: i have the main ones
FalconWiz: and still have to convert to opus
FalconWiz: that is with celt on kingles server
FalconWiz: hrmmm
FalconWiz: opus-ruby is coming along though
Eru-pc: ambitious project
Eru-pc: but veryt cool
FalconWiz: &lt; knows nothing about audio codecs
FalconWiz: &lt; is trying to make a wrapper
FalconWiz: lol
FalconWiz: kingles knows lots of ruby things though
Eru-pc: kingles is jokes smart dude
FalconWiz: yeah
FalconWiz: we're just kind of hacking at it until it works though, because it isn't very well documented lol
Eru-pc: best way to learn :D
FalconWiz: it's like
FalconWiz: people are smart enough to make really cool things
FalconWiz: but they dont document them
Eru-pc: yep
FalconWiz: and nobody knows how to use them
Eru-pc: yep
Eru-pc: welcome to github.com! :d
Eru-pc: lol
FalconWiz: but i mean like
FalconWiz: opus
FalconWiz: looks really good
FalconWiz: you'd think that professionally done things would have good documentation
Eru-pc: :P
Eru-pc: if only
Eru-pc: my advice
Eru-pc: is dont be afraid of reading the code
Eru-pc: most programmers write code and never read code
Eru-pc: imagine learning to write novels
Eru-pc: without ever reading
: we might have a problem eru
Eru-pc: ?
: &quot;When updating from 1.0.4 remove any conduits and ducts in your world and hold them in your inventory. Railcraft's invisible tracking block was removed because of bugs. However this causes ducts and conduits to go invisible and be unremovable when updating. This is not a Thermal Expansion bug.&quot;
: I'll tell you if it's causing problems
: but it might be causing problems
FalconWiz: hmmm
: nvm
: seems fine
: nvm nvm
: causing problems
: I have invisible unremovable blocks in my base
: you can either:
: A: leave things be
: some buggy blocks in my and whikihows base
: B: downgrade to 1.0.4
: temporarily
: then I clean things up
: then update again
Eru-pc: fffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuu
Eru-pc: :P
FalconWiz: dat hassle
Eru-pc: i gotta find the url
Eru-pc: fo rthe 1.0.4 server
: the joys of updating

kingles_work: Yaaaay
kingles_work: regex is a powerful tool :3
kingles_work: but also should be used only when it makes sense to
: well i used it there
kingles_work: but I think everyone way overuses regex when they first learn it
kingles_work: because it's really cool
erus_macbook: regex is typically 100 to 1000 times slower
: Dir['audio/*.fifo'].map{|file| file.split(/[\/.]/)[1]}
erus_macbook: than a split() or a substr

erus_macbook: who can recite regex
: and they were like
: regex
kingles_work: falcon what I meant for &quot;it should only be used when needed&quot; was that it's usually pretty slow and often there are more simple/elegant solutions!
: so i was like
